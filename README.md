# keypadInput


This program was created as an assignment for CSCI-SHU 350 - Embedded Computer Systems at NYU Shanghai. The program uses an STM32F746NG Discovery Board microcontroller. A keyboard is connected as a GPIO with the following configuration: a row is represented by a single pin and a column is also represented by a single pin.
The program implements a simple security system with the use of a state machine, that checks whether the correct password was entered.
